          <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
          <h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p>Autonomous Vehicles are going introduce automated vehicles on our roads, and it gets rid of the need for a person to be in control of the vehicle, it can drive to the locations of your choice by itself by also following the road laws, when it does that it will be able to remove the errors that humans cause (VicRoads, 2021) such as not paying attention, being on phones, taking drugs and/or being drunk and over the limit with alcohol. This technology is still new with Tesla being the one major company making electric + now automated cars as well (not fully however). Apple is reportedly researching electric cars which will also most likely be automated in some way which is due to be completed in 2024 (Stephen Nellis, 2021) and could serve as a competitor to Tesla and with the increased competition it will move the industry forward as companies will be trying to invent the wheel to make something that no other company has made before. It is also proposed that in time having automated cars will lessen the traffic on the roads as there will be less accidents from stuff like not paying attention on the road which clogs up the road allowing heaps of people to save time on their daily commute and having more time with family and making the drive to work less stressful for everyone.</p>

          <p>Within the next 3 years, we should start seeing everything become much more automated (VicRoads, 2021) as Apple finishes researching and Tesla and other car manufacturers start to switch to fully electric and begin automating their cars there will be more cars on the road that are driving by themselves, and we will start seeing new laws that are specific about automated cars and how they are to work which will probably include rules such as a driver must not be on the phone while the car is driving because even though it is automated, it can still make some mistakes since the technology is still relatively new. (Driverless cars working together can speed up traffic by 35 percent, 2021) This advancement in technology is happening because the rise of automation everywhere in the world is starting to take shape so it was obvious that cars will start being automated as we are learning how to create AI with programming, we are able to make technology do stuff that we used to have to do. It is also being pushed due to the rise of electric cars which gets rid of the need to use fuel, these electric cars are also getting automation features put on to them as it is becoming more viable as the cars are fully electric. (Driverless cars working together can speed up traffic by 35 percent, 2021).</p>

          <p>The UK has also forwarded a plan to ban sale of petrol cars by 2030 (Jolly, 2021) which will make electric cars more of an occurrence which means automated features in those electric cars will be used by a wider % of the population and other countries around the world are following by making similar laws (Jolly, 2021) as well although Australia is lagging a bit with these new laws, but Australia will most likely follow eventually as this makes car companies stop making petrol cars as it will not be profitable anymore and produce more electric cars that have automation, there will most likely also be a time when petrol cars are banned completely due to it being an issue with automated cars as cars that are not automated can be as unpredictable as the driver so the driver can accidently crash into an automated car when it would have been better if the car was an automated there would have been no crashes. (Driverless cars working together can speed up traffic by 35 percent, 2021).</p>

          <p>This is why I believe that automated vehicles are the future in the car industry, and we will start seeing more of them as time goes on and especially in the near future.</p>

          <h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p>The potential impact of this development is that our roads will be very different with the vehicles being controlled by a computer with minimum human input most likely to happen during an emergency or if the vehicle fails to drive properly while it is autonomous. While cars become autonomous it is likely that there will be less traffic on the road as autonomous cars are going to be much more efficient drivers. People will most likely become worse drivers as there won’t be a need for them to be driving all the time so slowly their driving skills won’t be as good as it would have been if it wasn’t for self-driving cars.</p>

          <p>This new autonomous car will most likely won’t create new jobs as it is in fact getting rid of jobs, first what will happen is the Taxi Drivers will most likely will just be in the car to make sure it does not crash into anything because the self-driving system might stuff up, however as time goes it is probable that they will be completely gone and cars will be good enough to not need another person to even sit in the car to make sure it is doing what It is meant to do. This may be the end of Taxi Drivers especially in the form that they are in now, however it will make the road safer for everyone at the end of the day and everyone won’t be at the mercy of other people's reckless behaviour on the roads. It is important to understand it won’t be just Taxi Drivers who lose their jobs or have their job cut into smaller work, same could be said for Bus Drivers, Truck Drivers, Delivery Drivers, Train Drivers and many other jobs who rely on a person to drive a vehicle to one point to another they will be replaced with a computer who will do the job for the companies without the need of a driver working long hours, they will all be affected by this however it might make making a delivery cheaper, taking a bus cheaper etc. As the companies won’t need to worry about taking in to account the worker's salary all the time which will save them a lot of money.</p>

          <h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p>The automation of vehicles will affect me in a positive way as I believe that this technology will benefit me as I will have more free time and I do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic slowly moving for an hour while getting work. I also believe it will affect me because of how I use my personal vehicle as it is believed that in the future it might be come shared vehicles where it will come to you when you need it, and it will take you anywhere and it will most likely be cheap as there won’t be need to have an actual driver that has to be paid for his job. I also believe that public transportation with bus and trains will become more available to the public, and it will be extremely commonplace which might in some cases remove any need for a car if you live in metropolitan Melbourne. My family especially the elderly will be able to be transported in cars safer because when they become old, they start having slower reaction and overall driving skills so this would be a huge plus for them as they will be able go places without worrying that they will crash somewhere and possibly sustain a serious injury or even pass away, this relieves a lot of stress for everyone in a society, this is how automation will be very different for me. It will affect my friends in a positive way as they will not have to worry about taking public transport in the middle of the night as they will be able to be in a self-driving car by themselves and they won’t have to worry about being fully awake as they won’t be the ones driving this will make going out much easier for everyone. </p>

          <h3>Cyber security</h3>
          <h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p>Cyber Security is the process of insure only the necessary people have access to a device or network to prevent damage or theft of data. Cyber security is very important in an increasingly online world; more and more personal data is being put on computers and it will need to be protected from bad actors. In the future there will be information about a person we don’t keep online that will be digital, this could be something like a Personal ID which is becoming a reality now and will need to be protected, in places like North America where social security numbers exist and are already stored online problems with security are already encountered and there is still more important information being put online. Cyber security has been around as long as computers have, the oldest form being a lock on the door to the first computer and in a lot of cases it is still the same today as the first line of cyber security is preventing anyone from reaching a computer or network. Some forms of cyber security commonly used are passwords, encryptions or a firewall to list a few. In recent years there as been a big push for more security and privacy, technologies such as password managers and VPNs have become more popular and general practices such as using strong passwords and only use a password once and having 2 factor authentication wherever possible. there is also user behavior analysis, this is when a program detects unusual activity from an account such as strange purchases on a card or logging in from a different location to usual. On a less personally responsible level of security there is the cloud. Keeping stuff on the cloud lets a company give you or anyone only the information they want said person to have and prevents said person from looking at anything else. </p>

          <p>Some new technologies or at least old technologies used in new ways is hardware authentication, where a piece of hardware in your computer is used to identify a you (your computer) this has the plus side of being very hard to replicate especially if they have to replicate more than one piece of hardware but it also has the issue of requiring more information, if someone does manage to get the information now they know even more about you. Another new technology is machine learning and deep learning, this is sort of similar to the behavior analysis mentioned before but this is using these technologies to themselves or using them to develop algorithms to find fraud or unusual behavior on accounts. Machine and deep learning (hopefully) will allow companies to spot the fraud faster and more accurately then before because they will be able to analyze more data better than a human could. </p>

          <p>On the other side of new technologies are the ones which make security easier to breach then before. Roughly every two years the number of transistors on a chip doubles meaning it becomes easier for computers newer computers to simply brute force security on older computers. Brute forcing is when a security system has lots of passwords of phrases thrown at it to see what works. This is often done after a database breach to discover passwords, in the case of a database breach they will create lots of passwords based of a list of commonly used passwords and then compare the encrypted ones in the database to the new passwords so that they can find out what you use as a password and see if you use it elsewhere such as your email or banking account. In an attempt to stop this a salt can be added to the a password before encryption so that an encrypted password is not so easily read as the salt will need to be known first. Even if a salt is know there is other ways to stop an attack such as BCrypt which works by being slow, this prevents brute force attack even as computers get faster and faster because the speed with which it salts and encrypts a string can be increased to a point where it would take to much time for the intruder to create and compare the passwords.</p>
          
          <h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p>The world is becoming a more digital place which means cyber security is becoming a more essential and normal part of life, to some extent you can’t go anywhere nowadays without some sort of digital id, something like your mobile phone or your miki are digital devices, most people's phones contain a lot of personal Information, and it is vital that the security on the is sound. A solution for cyber security that is becoming more common is biometrics. Biometrics are parts of a human such as their voice, fingerprint, face and eyes. This isn't an exhaustive list, but these are the most commonly used biometrics. The issue with biometrics as they are now is that you are giving something more information, arguably more important information to protect other information. As time goes on biometric technologies will get more advance, more accurately identify people and likely have better cyber security in itself (storing your biometric data securely). A lot of devices feature biometrics already, both phones and computers now have face scanning, fingerprint scanners as well as assistants such as google assist or Siri who will only respond to your voice.</p>

          <p>Developing cyber security technologies and practices will make redundant old technologies and practices simply because as they get older they become less safe the more vulnerabilities are discovered. Older OS get abandoned after a decade or so meaning there wont be any fixes if a vulnerability is found. Advancing cyber security wont make any jobs redundant exactly but it will change what they need to learn but it will absolutely create new jobs, the field gets broader as time goes on and will require people to specialize more and more, there will need to be people to program this new technology and people who show others how to use it.</p>
          
          <h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p>On a day-to-day basis this will have a big change as people will no longer have to remember passwords or risk using the same password again as their unique identifier is themselves. This can also mean that people have to be more careful with this information because it can still be stolen. the people that don’t want to use their biometrics have the option of password managers which are a convenience that are better then using the same password. Hopefully in the future security will be really good but there is always the problem of human error, phishing and clumsiness which cause data breaches.</p>

          <p>On an individual basis many people won't change how they treat their cyber security as it is either more work then they are willing to put in or they don’t believe it will affect them.</p>

          <p>In the future I believe people will start seeing friends and family get affected by identity theft and scams even though there is a generation growing up having never known a life without the internet there will always be people who either aren't cautions enough or don’t know better, the types of scams or attacks will also change along with how people act so its not like people or technology will eventually surpass the ability to trick humans.</p>
          
          <p>On a more positive notes there are technologies being developed to inform people of their lapses in judgement such as have I been PWNED or breach alarm to tell users if their password or email is present in a data breach. VPNs are also becoming more popular which protect your privacy online and protect you on public wifi but it also means if the VPN host is hacked then all of what you do online to an extent is now know to whoever caused the breach.</p>

          <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
          <h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p>Blockchain is some database where it is designed to record any information, for example digitally timestamps information and make the information difficult or impossible to manipulate, hack, or cheat the system. Essentially, it is described to be a digital ledger (open to the public) of transactions where it is duplicated and distributed across entire computer systems, commonly used for obtaining and selling cryptocurrencies to add some form of security during transactions. Blockchain plays a role in cryptocurrency by allowing transactions being approved and sent to anywhere and anyone in the world, without the need of central authority (a key organisation) for currency exchanging or any interferences from banks. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum is a digital currency that makes use of blockchain technology to note down records and provide security for every transaction. Furthermore, it allows individuals with cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services, for example cars, phones and homes just like a digital form of cash, however, it uses blockchain for added security and protection for every transaction made unlike materialised cash where theft and hackers can manipulate and take advantage of the exposed security. Additionally, due to the scarcity of cryptocurrencies, “Bitcoin never goes beyond 21 million coins”, towards most of the public, this has caused its value to rise exponentially over time, where 1 bitcoin can value to 79615.85 Australian Dollar.</p>

          <p>Due to blockchain being not widely known and popular around the world yet, there has not been many enhancements and revolution to improve the current state of Blockchain. Due to this, we may see Blockchain to remain the same in its current state until cryptocurrency gain massive popularity, where it will allow Blockchain to become well known and become a necessity to improve and enhance its current technology for other individuals to take advantage. On the other hand, cryptocurrency beginning in 2009 has been gaining popularity since the late 2010 where other cryptocurrencies has been implemented other than Bitcoin, for example, Litecoin. Since then, the raise of popularity in cryptocurrency has caused the value of Bitcoin and other alternatives to raise, due to more individuals obtaining and investing their time in cryptocurrency, which made other similar alternatives of cryptocurrency within the technology for individuals to purchase.</p>

          <p>With the very little popularity and knowledge of Blockchain around the world, it would be appropriate to educate many people about Blockchain as it can help improve the current state of its technology and make it widely used around the world, as well as taking advantage of its current benefits such as security and privacy. Similarly, we should also increase the popularity and knowledge of cryptocurrencies to help educate individuals around online transactions. From this, we soon will be benefited with only transactions that relies on online transactions, such as using crypto to purchase goods and services, as well as use Blockchain to remember our records and protect our transactions.</p>

          <p>In the next three years, we may see the raise of cryptocurrency as technology continues to advance, society will become more invested to the internet where we will rely on paying our goods and services online and ditch our wallets. From this, individuals may investigate and invest in cryptocurrency for their payments which will allow cryptocurrency to become more accessible and easier to obtain than before. As cryptocurrency grows, we will also see the raise of Blockchain as security and privacy will also need improving as more individuals will obtain cryptocurrency as their form of currency.</p>

          <p>Over time as computer parts continues to improve, most importantly graphics cards, this will make mining cryptocurrency easier for individuals where they can invest less time and money to gain 1 Bitcoin. However, this is only suitable for individuals with the knowledge of computers and cryptocurrency to invest in Bitcoin, as well as the amount of wealth they have and the amount of time they have on them.</p>

          <h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p>There’s likely to be not much impact and activity from Blockchain, and it is a relatively new concept for many people around the world, causing this technology to remain its current state and not further being improved and implemented in other parts of the world. However, cryptocurrency is likely having a different impact as cryptocurrency being well known around the world and many people are trying to invest their time and money into cryptocurrency, we will an influx of new people joining the world of cryptocurrency over time.</p>

          <p>The potential impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain is that society will become accustomed to cryptocurrency where it will be seen to be widely used by many people as they would have acquired the technology and knowledge to assist them in gathering bitcoin and similar alternatives. With many people adopting to cryptocurrency, we will also see Blockchain being constantly updated and improved to ensure security and privacy is constantly protected from hackers and viruses. Furthermore, we will also see Blockchain not only being used for cryptocurrency but also for other businesses and real-world transactions where banks and central authority will become outdated, as many will see this technology to be reliable for this current society.</p>

          <p>The worlds’ currency will likely be heavily impacted and changed as cryptocurrency keeps raising in popularity and soon becoming the normal currency in our society. This change will likely occur and change as it will be easier and understandable for many individuals to share the same currency around the world, allowing people to send money to someone in a different country without the need to exchange currency or use the banks to assist them in this exchange. However, the value of cryptocurrency will be deeply impacted on as many individuals will obtain bitcoin and other similar alternatives, causing the value of cryptocurrencies to fall and lose its value that it’s famous for.</p>

          <p>People around the world will be most affected no matter the age as a new form currency and payment system will be implemented where every individual will eagerly prefer when purchasing goods and services, and to take advantage of the Blockchain technology. With people aged from 18-60 years old, this change will be easy for them to be accustomed to and that they will likely prefer this form of currency and payment system to purchase their goods and services. Yet, people aged 60+ will struggle to get accustomed to this change as they will have difficulties learning and understanding cryptocurrency and blockchain as their security, where they mostly prefer the old-fashioned way of purchasing their goods and services.</p>

          <p>With this change of our current currency and payment system, this will create new jobs where we will be required to maintain the flow of cryptocurrency, stock market and form new security where to enforce new regulations and technologies in gaining Bitcoin. Also, with Blockchain being widely implemented around the world, it will be appropriate to employ new people to help maintain the privacy and security of every record and transaction around the world. However, we will see bank employees being made redundant as we will not see them as a requirement when putting in transactions using Blockchain.</p>

          <h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p>I will need to understand and gain the knowledge needed to understand cryptocurrency and blockchain to assist myself to have a smooth transition into using Bitcoin as my form of payment. This change will force me to invest heavily on high-end computer parts, such as graphics card to help me mine and gain bitcoin over time, as well as sacrifice my current hobbies to free up the time needed to allow myself to make a steady income from bitcoin and other similar alternatives.</p>

          <p>In my daily life, it depends on my luck as I may either be richer than before or even more poor than usual due to me sacrificing most of my everyday life investing into cryptocurrency. If I manage to be lucky and gain a steady income of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, my daily life will be different as my wealth will increase to the point where I can afford the goods and services that I weren’t able to afford before. However, if I become unsuccessful in mining Bitcoin, I will struggle to keep up financially as I may find it difficult to earn my money back from the computer parts I invested into gaining cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The things that will be only different from me is my wealth status as this will depend on that I will be living luxurious from me mining cryptocurrency or struggle financially which will make it difficult for me to purchase the goods and services that I require in my daily life.</p>

          <p>My brothers may also invest their time into understanding cryptocurrency and Blockchain as they may see this other form of income and opportunity for their future. Furthermore, my friends will also be likely to invest their time into understanding cryptocurrency and Blockchain as they will see this an opportunity into gaining income in the future due to its raise in popularity. However, my parents may steer away from cryptocurrency and not bother wasting their time into looking into Blockchain, Bitcoin, and Litecoin as they will prefer to stick to the old fashion of earning income.</p>

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p>Machine learning is the field of creating programs which rather than have preprogrammed outcomes are instead given data to base their outcomes on i.e., to learn. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence and is one of the more popular fields within. A lot of artificial intelligence now is ANI or artificial narrow intelligence which focuses on complete a set goal or task as well as possible or as close to a human would, these tasks are often simple and are more artificial than intelligent. Machine learning on the other hand hopes to create something which is AGI or artificial general intelligence. AGI is AI which can perform tasks like a human or better but instead of having preprogrammed parameters or outcomes has the ability to learn and hopefully bring us one step closer to the technology singularity. Machine learning comes in many forms but the currently most promising and most popular is artificial neural networks which are based on the human brain, in which a series of connected neurons or nodes receive data then send this information to another node until the best outcome it can create based off the given data set is reached. There is much more to ANN but that was just a simple explanation. There is also decision trees, linear regression or k Nearest Neighbors to name a few. </p>

          <p>Machine learning has been a concept since at least 1955 but has likely existed before that, though it has been around for so long it is only in recent years that it has made significant progress. With the increase in power of computers and the increase in the amount of data being created every second the combing of data has become so much easier allowing for machine learning programs to easily or at least more efficiently get started. </p>

          <p>A big issue with today's Machine learning methods is that each ‘machine’ so to say only has knowledge about one topic and would get lost when trying to analyze anything else. Many experts have tried creating more holistic Machine learning methods which would combine lots of different algorithms to a whole so that they can analyse something based on the output without having to create a whole new network.  </p>
		  
		  <p>There is also deep learning which is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial neural networks. Deep learning is almost wholly about ANN but differentiates itself form general machine learning in that there is multiple layers to the ANN or whichever method of machine learning is used e.g. (convolution neural network). Deep learning uses multiple layers of machine learning to pull more and more abstract layers of information within a given dataset to see or analyse information not retally apparent to humans or other machine learning techniques, the layers part of deep learning is where it gets the Deep part of its name from. </p>
          
		  <p>In the future there is a lot to look forward to with machine learning, already machine learning has been used to improve medicine, computer chips, building or automobile design. It is reasonable to see in the future lots of industries implementing machine learning to improve themselves and their products. There are machine learning algorithms which were used to predict how a toxin would affect a cell in the human body and in the future, they may be used to detect genetic problems in humans like how services like 23 and me or my ancestry already do. There is also the prospect of self-improving machine learning or AI that becomes more efficient though that is often the subject of dystopian fiction it can be a good thing, it will allow a level of improvement simply not possible by humans themselves, we already use ai to improve technology, but this is a level that would be unprecedented. </p>
		  <p>As mentioned before there has been a huge improvement of the power of computers which allow massive amounts of data to be gathered and shared for the purpose of machine learning, as bad as it is with tech companies gathering your personal data there is the upside of it allowing machine learning algorithms to become more accurate, though these same algorithms are being used to gather more data from you in a sense so take it as you will. </p>
		  <h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p>I'm not sure if its possible to see the full impact of what machine learning posses, it is a very powerful technology with massive potential for change, the ability for a machine to do what a human does but faster and to a higher standard. The most immediate impact of machine learning I can see it efficiency, the removal of human error from the equation meaning that less mistakes and better decisions are made. And as processors get more powerful it will be possible to put machine learning ai on phones, desktops or laptops to improve the user experience.  Now, and I'm sure in the future is the use of machine learning to advertise to people, The algorithms can already predict what a person want based of things that to a human look completely unrelated.  </p>

          <p>Machine learning is being tested in a variety of ways which we may see widely used in the future. For example spell check and word prediction use machine learning but they are always looking for new ways to improve the feature, like did you know Microsoft word reads through your outlook emails to see if it can relate something in your document that may have been mentioned in an email. No one else can see what's in your emails just you,  thought that was interesting was all. </p>

          <p>Another likely impact of machine learning is menial Labour or data entry type jobs will be made redundant as the machine will be able to analyze and enter the information itself, It also doesn’t help that data entry is a disappearing job already, theoretically any job could be replaced by a sufficiently advance algorithm or AI but it the simpler one which will disappear first, even things like art, music and stories are starting to be created by AI. The thing is that anything can be replaced by machine learning, programs, people, technologies are all able to be replaced or made redundant because that is the goal of machine learning. </p>
          <h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p>Machine learning will have a direct impact on everyone's lives as it already does. People will not be creating machine learning algorithms themselves but they will interact with them. It is possible for everything to be determined by a neural network; every aspect of your life predetermined. That is likely pretty far off but something in the immediate future could be it involved in schooling, students being told careers they might enjoy or be good at based on subjects they take. Students already interact with machine learning when submitting assessments as plagiarism checkers.</p>

          <p>Machine learning could help with scheduling and planning, it already determines the best route for things such as google maps, uber or lyft but take it a step further to day planning so your schedule and others schedules are as efficient as can be allowing you more free time.  </p>

          <p>If you buy stocks a lot of the apps use machine learning to give you advice when to sell or buy based on the information of other users using machine learning or some people even use machine learning to automatically buy and sell for them. </p>
		  
		  <p>YouTube on other platforms use machine learning to recommend content to you but in the future it may be more accurate resulting in you spending more time on an app, or better advertising meaning you are more likely to buy something or spend more money. </p>

          <p>Machine learning has lots of possibilities, It is great at solving problems and improving upon designs, if it can still be improved then it will benefit from machine learning. If it is too much work for a person, it can probably be done by a machine. In the future the only thing we may need to ask with adding machine learning to something is not whether or not we can, but whether or not we should. </p>

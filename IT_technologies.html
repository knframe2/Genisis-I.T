          <h3>Autonomous Vehicles - Robert</h3>
          <h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p>Autonomous Vehicles are going introduce automated vehicles on our roads, and it gets rid of the need for a person to be in control of the vehicle, it can drive to the locations of your choice by itself by also following the road laws, when it does that it will be able to remove the errors that humans cause (VicRoads, 2021) such as not paying attention, being on phones, taking drugs and/or being drunk and over the limit with alcohol. This technology is still new with Tesla being the one major company making electric + now automated cars as well (not fully however). Apple is reportedly researching electric cars which will also most likely be automated in some way which is due to be completed in 2024 (Stephen Nellis, 2021) and could serve as a competitor to Tesla and with the increased competition it will move the industry forward as companies will be trying to invent the wheel to make something that no other company has made before. It is also proposed that in time having automated cars will lessen the traffic on the roads as there will be less accidents from stuff like not paying attention on the road which clogs up the road allowing heaps of people to save time on their daily commute and having more time with family and making the drive to work less stressful for everyone.</p>

          <p>Within the next 3 years, we should start seeing everything become much more automated (VicRoads, 2021) as Apple finishes researching and Tesla and other car manufacturers start to switch to fully electric and begin automating their cars there will be more cars on the road that are driving by themselves, and we will start seeing new laws that are specific about automated cars and how they are to work which will probably include rules such as a driver must not be on the phone while the car is driving because even though it is automated, it can still make some mistakes since the technology is still relatively new. (Driverless cars working together can speed up traffic by 35 percent, 2021) This advancement in technology is happening because the rise of automation everywhere in the world is starting to take shape so it was obvious that cars will start being automated as we are learning how to create AI with programming, we are able to make technology do stuff that we used to have to do. It is also being pushed due to the rise of electric cars which gets rid of the need to use fuel, these electric cars are also getting automation features put on to them as it is becoming more viable as the cars are fully electric. (Driverless cars working together can speed up traffic by 35 percent, 2021).</p>

          <p>The UK has also forwarded a plan to ban sale of petrol cars by 2030 (Jolly, 2021) which will make electric cars more of an occurrence which means automated features in those electric cars will be used by a wider % of the population and other countries around the world are following by making similar laws (Jolly, 2021) as well although Australia is lagging a bit with these new laws, but Australia will most likely follow eventually as this makes car companies stop making petrol cars as it will not be profitable anymore and produce more electric cars that have automation, there will most likely also be a time when petrol cars are banned completely due to it being an issue with automated cars as cars that are not automated can be as unpredictable as the driver so the driver can accidently crash into an automated car when it would have been better if the car was an automated there would have been no crashes. (Driverless cars working together can speed up traffic by 35 percent, 2021).</p>

          <p>This is why I believe that automated vehicles are the future in the car industry, and we will start seeing more of them as time goes on and especially in the near future.</p>

          <h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p>The potential impact of this development is that our roads will be very different with the vehicles being controlled by a computer with minimum human input most likely to happen during an emergency or if the vehicle fails to drive properly while it is autonomous. While cars become autonomous it is likely that there will be less traffic on the road as autonomous cars are going to be much more efficient drivers. People will most likely become worse drivers as there won’t be a need for them to be driving all the time so slowly their driving skills won’t be as good as it would have been if it wasn’t for self-driving cars.</p>

          <p>This new autonomous car will most likely won’t create new jobs as it is in fact getting rid of jobs, first what will happen is the Taxi Drivers will most likely will just be in the car to make sure it does not crash into anything because the self-driving system might stuff up, however as time goes it is probable that they will be completely gone and cars will be good enough to not need another person to even sit in the car to make sure it is doing what It is meant to do. This may be the end of Taxi Drivers especially in the form that they are in now, however it will make the road safer for everyone at the end of the day and everyone won’t be at the mercy of other people's reckless behaviour on the roads. It is important to understand it won’t be just Taxi Drivers who lose their jobs or have their job cut into smaller work, same could be said for Bus Drivers, Truck Drivers, Delivery Drivers, Train Drivers and many other jobs who rely on a person to drive a vehicle to one point to another they will be replaced with a computer who will do the job for the companies without the need of a driver working long hours, they will all be affected by this however it might make making a delivery cheaper, taking a bus cheaper etc. As the companies won’t need to worry about taking in to account the worker's salary all the time which will save them a lot of money.</p>

          <h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p>The automation of vehicles will affect me in a positive way as I believe that this technology will benefit me as I will have more free time and I do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic slowly moving for an hour while getting work. I also believe it will affect me because of how I use my personal vehicle as it is believed that in the future it might be come shared vehicles where it will come to you when you need it, and it will take you anywhere and it will most likely be cheap as there won’t be need to have an actual driver that has to be paid for his job. I also believe that public transportation with bus and trains will become more available to the public, and it will be extremely commonplace which might in some cases remove any need for a car if you live in metropolitan Melbourne. My family especially the elderly will be able to be transported in cars safer because when they become old, they start having slower reaction and overall driving skills so this would be a huge plus for them as they will be able go places without worrying that they will crash somewhere and possibly sustain a serious injury or even pass away, this relieves a lot of stress for everyone in a society, this is how automation will be very different for me. It will affect my friends in a positive way as they will not have to worry about taking public transport in the middle of the night as they will be able to be in a self-driving car by themselves and they won’t have to worry about being fully awake as they won’t be the ones driving this will make going out much easier for everyone. </p>

          <h3>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies – Hayden</h3>
          <h4>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
          <p>Blockchain is some database where it is designed to record any information, for example digitally timestamps information and make the information difficult or impossible to manipulate, hack, or cheat the system. Essentially, it is described to be a digital ledger (open to the public) of transactions where it is duplicated and distributed across entire computer systems, commonly used for obtaining and selling cryptocurrencies to add some form of security during transactions. Blockchain plays a role in cryptocurrency by allowing transactions being approved and sent to anywhere and anyone in the world, without the need of central authority (a key organisation) for currency exchanging or any interferences from banks. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum is a digital currency that makes use of blockchain technology to note down records and provide security for every transaction. Furthermore, it allows individuals with cryptocurrency to purchase goods and services, for example cars, phones and homes just like a digital form of cash, however, it uses blockchain for added security and protection for every transaction made unlike materialised cash where theft and hackers can manipulate and take advantage of the exposed security. Additionally, due to the scarcity of cryptocurrencies, “Bitcoin never goes beyond 21 million coins”, towards most of the public, this has caused its value to rise exponentially over time, where 1 bitcoin can value to 79615.85 Australian Dollar.</p>

          <p>Due to blockchain being not widely known and popular around the world yet, there has not been many enhancements and revolution to improve the current state of Blockchain. Due to this, we may see Blockchain to remain the same in its current state until cryptocurrency gain massive popularity, where it will allow Blockchain to become well known and become a necessity to improve and enhance its current technology for other individuals to take advantage. On the other hand, cryptocurrency beginning in 2009 has been gaining popularity since the late 2010 where other cryptocurrencies has been implemented other than Bitcoin, for example, Litecoin. Since then, the raise of popularity in cryptocurrency has caused the value of Bitcoin and other alternatives to raise, due to more individuals obtaining and investing their time in cryptocurrency, which made other similar alternatives of cryptocurrency within the technology for individuals to purchase.</p>

          <p>With the very little popularity and knowledge of Blockchain around the world, it would be appropriate to educate many people about Blockchain as it can help improve the current state of its technology and make it widely used around the world, as well as taking advantage of its current benefits such as security and privacy. Similarly, we should also increase the popularity and knowledge of cryptocurrencies to help educate individuals around online transactions. From this, we soon will be benefited with only transactions that relies on online transactions, such as using crypto to purchase goods and services, as well as use Blockchain to remember our records and protect our transactions.</p>

          <p>In the next three years, we may see the raise of cryptocurrency as technology continues to advance, society will become more invested to the internet where we will rely on paying our goods and services online and ditch our wallets. From this, individuals may investigate and invest in cryptocurrency for their payments which will allow cryptocurrency to become more accessible and easier to obtain than before. As cryptocurrency grows, we will also see the raise of Blockchain as security and privacy will also need improving as more individuals will obtain cryptocurrency as their form of currency.</p>

          <p>Over time as computer parts continues to improve, most importantly graphics cards, this will make mining cryptocurrency easier for individuals where they can invest less time and money to gain 1 Bitcoin. However, this is only suitable for individuals with the knowledge of computers and cryptocurrency to invest in Bitcoin, as well as the amount of wealth they have and the amount of time they have on them.</p>

          <h4>What is the likely impact? What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
          <p>There’s likely to be not much impact and activity from Blockchain, and it is a relatively new concept for many people around the world, causing this technology to remain its current state and not further being improved and implemented in other parts of the world. However, cryptocurrency is likely having a different impact as cryptocurrency being well known around the world and many people are trying to invest their time and money into cryptocurrency, we will an influx of new people joining the world of cryptocurrency over time.</p>

          <p>The potential impact of cryptocurrency and blockchain is that society will become accustomed to cryptocurrency where it will be seen to be widely used by many people as they would have acquired the technology and knowledge to assist them in gathering bitcoin and similar alternatives. With many people adopting to cryptocurrency, we will also see Blockchain being constantly updated and improved to ensure security and privacy is constantly protected from hackers and viruses. Furthermore, we will also see Blockchain not only being used for cryptocurrency but also for other businesses and real-world transactions where banks and central authority will become outdated, as many will see this technology to be reliable for this current society.</p>

          <p>The worlds’ currency will likely be heavily impacted and changed as cryptocurrency keeps raising in popularity and soon becoming the normal currency in our society. This change will likely occur and change as it will be easier and understandable for many individuals to share the same currency around the world, allowing people to send money to someone in a different country without the need to exchange currency or use the banks to assist them in this exchange. However, the value of cryptocurrency will be deeply impacted on as many individuals will obtain bitcoin and other similar alternatives, causing the value of cryptocurrencies to fall and lose its value that it’s famous for.</p>

          <p>People around the world will be most affected no matter the age as a new form currency and payment system will be implemented where every individual will eagerly prefer when purchasing goods and services, and to take advantage of the Blockchain technology. With people aged from 18-60 years old, this change will be easy for them to be accustomed to and that they will likely prefer this form of currency and payment system to purchase their goods and services. Yet, people aged 60+ will struggle to get accustomed to this change as they will have difficulties learning and understanding cryptocurrency and blockchain as their security, where they mostly prefer the old-fashioned way of purchasing their goods and services.</p>

          <p>With this change of our current currency and payment system, this will create new jobs where we will be required to maintain the flow of cryptocurrency, stock market and form new security where to enforce new regulations and technologies in gaining Bitcoin. Also, with Blockchain being widely implemented around the world, it will be appropriate to employ new people to help maintain the privacy and security of every record and transaction around the world. However, we will see bank employees being made redundant as we will not see them as a requirement when putting in transactions using Blockchain.</p>

          <h4>How will this affect you? In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>
          <p>I will need to understand and gain the knowledge needed to understand cryptocurrency and blockchain to assist myself to have a smooth transition into using Bitcoin as my form of payment. This change will force me to invest heavily on high-end computer parts, such as graphics card to help me mine and gain bitcoin over time, as well as sacrifice my current hobbies to free up the time needed to allow myself to make a steady income from bitcoin and other similar alternatives.</p>

          <p>In my daily life, it depends on my luck as I may either be richer than before or even more poor than usual due to me sacrificing most of my everyday life investing into cryptocurrency. If I manage to be lucky and gain a steady income of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, my daily life will be different as my wealth will increase to the point where I can afford the goods and services that I weren’t able to afford before. However, if I become unsuccessful in mining Bitcoin, I will struggle to keep up financially as I may find it difficult to earn my money back from the computer parts I invested into gaining cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The things that will be only different from me is my wealth status as this will depend on that I will be living luxurious from me mining cryptocurrency or struggle financially which will make it difficult for me to purchase the goods and services that I require in my daily life.</p>

          <p>My brothers may also invest their time into understanding cryptocurrency and Blockchain as they may see this other form of income and opportunity for their future. Furthermore, my friends will also be likely to invest their time into understanding cryptocurrency and Blockchain as they will see this an opportunity into gaining income in the future due to its raise in popularity. However, my parents may steer away from cryptocurrency and not bother wasting their time into looking into Blockchain, Bitcoin, and Litecoin as they will prefer to stick to the old fashion of earning income.</p>

These skills are important, but they aren’t specific to Software Developers and can be extended to a huge number of jobs and having skills such as being able to solve complex problems is important as you will need it to be able to write a program for your client and you will run in to complex problems that will need to be fixed in order to accomplish the job.  </td>

Furthermore, less demand could also mean less competition, making it easier for me to be employed to the specific I want to land in.  </td>

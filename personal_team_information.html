<h2> Personal Information:  </h2>
<p><b> Gabriel Duke:</b> My name is Gabriel Duke, my student number at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) is s3785307,<br> I have grown up here in Melbourne, I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Science (Biology). My hobbies include boxing, numismatics, comic books, and collecting Vinyl records.<br>
 My interest in IT is purely to learn practical ways to stay up to date in the 21st century and to make sure I can stay relevant to the ever-growing technology industry.<br>
 I have zero experience in IT, so I am extremely excited to be working with our team Genesis I.T.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>Robert Mitrovski: I am an 18-year-old who is doing a Bachelor of Information Technology (1st Year) studying at RMIT.<br> During my spare time my hobbies are to play video games and to read about history. 
 My favourite part about I.T is web development<br> and I’m also interested with keeping up to date with the newest hardware. 
 My experience with I.T is still small so please don’t go too hard on me ha ha <br> but I will try my very best to help the team to the best of my ability. I look forward to working with all you guys this semester!

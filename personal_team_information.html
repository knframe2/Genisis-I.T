          <p>Being the “Protagonist” a so called ‘natural born leader, full of passion and charisma’ I have a fantastic opportunity to work with others and help them grow and achieve their goals in this team.</p>

          <p>Being a ‘kinesthetic learner’ shows that I get most of my education through actions rather than reading or listening to lectures. This can help in the team through my urge to get stuck into the work and get things done to make the most of this assignment.</p>

          <p>Being a ‘transformative leader’ should allow me to share our successes as a team and make sure everyone feels valued for their contributions!</p>

          <p>I belong to INTP-T, I like to constantly improve myself and learn new stuff I am under the ’logician’ category I like to think in a more logical way, and this is a good trait to have as I believe it will help the group a lot when we are working on our assignment. I am however not very good with my creativity a lot however either way I will try my best to be creative as well and not just logical.</p>
          <h4>Liam Higginson</h4>
          <p>My personality type is INTJ-A. This archetype highlights that I am a perfectionist who is quite introverted. Having an “Architect” personality would be very useful in team work as I usually prefer ‘quality’ over ‘quantity’. In addition to be more thinking than feeling, that my rational brain holds more power over my emotional brain. Although sometimes the “Architect” personality is inconsistent as some days I lack motivation for perfection while others I do. </p>
          <h4>Hayden Lay</h4>
          <img src="images/Haydens_myerstest.PNG" width="150px">
          <p>My personality being the Defender (ISFJ-T), this illustrates myself to be introverted – shy and not wanting to interact with other people, observant – analyse situations and individuals’ expressions, feeling – more emotionally driven than rationally, judging – I identify whether a risk is worth taking or not, and turbulent – always aim to push myself and go above and beyond with my work and tasks. These results gave me a proper overview of myself where I am the reserved type of person who has good analytical abilities, well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. </p>
          <img src="images/Hayden's_learningtest.PNG" width="300px">
          <p>These results portray me as a visual learner where I should learn new concepts or ideas by reading or seeing pictures. From this idea, it is better for me to understand and remember things by sight and can picture what I am learning in my head. Furthermore, I should be neat and clean and avoid sounds and spoken directions as this can cause difficulties during my learning.</p>
          <img src="images/Hayden's_bigfivepersonalitytest.PNG" width="475px">
          <p>My extroversion results depict myself to be in the middle with a score percentile of 29, meaning that I can usually be outgoing and social and shy and nervous depending on the environment and the mood. My emotional stability shows to be very high with a score percentile of 62, explaining that I tend to be emotionally calm and stable, and I react less emotionally and less easily upset. My agreeableness is also shown to be high with a score percentile of 40, demonstrating that I am friendly and optimistic which allows me to make friends easily and always positive about certain outcomes such as this assignment. My conscientiousness is seen to be high with a score percentile of 46, indicating that I am careful with my actions and words, along with diligence in my work and tasks which means I will perform better on completing tasks on time. Lastly, my intellect/imagination scored low with a score percentile of 8, signifying that I tend to follow traditional and conventional paths than using my intellect or creativity. From this, this could make it difficult for tasks that are designed to use your imaginary and creativeness which can make it harder for me to handle and complete the assignment.</p>
          <h4>Issac Miles</h4>
          <p>The Myers Briggs test identified me as ISTP which they describe as creative and practical, they like to create and design stuff. They are also relaxed, not worrying what the future might bring. The virtuoso can also be stubborn, ignoring other ideas or criticisms. They can be private, reserved and insensitive making it hard for people to understand them and coming off as rude. These traits are great for working on projects but not in a team so much and I do hope I embody them and can use it to help the team, and if I do possess the negative traits of the personality type I can see past them and work well in a team.</p>

          <p>The learning style test says I am a visual learner, I learn from watching others which should help working in a team as I can learn from other on my team easily just from watching them work or seeing their work.</p>

          <p>The big five personality trait test put me as mostly agreeable, conscientious, emotional stable and intelligent/imaginative while scoring low in extroversion which like the Myers Briggs test my be a sign of difficulty working in groups but otherwise good at solving problems and working on projects.</p>
          <h4>Ashley Hu</h4>
          <p>The results suggest that I am an open-minded person who is open to new ideas as well as being a more extroverted individual as well as someone who prefers a hands-on approach to tasks. This would mean that in a team environment I would be someone that prefers to initiate conversation and put ideas forward. I would also be someone that would suggest trying something even if I am unsure if it will be guaranteed to work. As a result, I could provide good leadership and direction to be a voice for a group. However, the downside could be that I may disregard the ideas of others or overlook certain steps that require more thorough thinking.</p>
          <p>I believe the results are somewhat indicative of my personality and I agree with the traits listed by the results. While some statements are very specifically targeted, I believe that these results provide a broad overview of my personality and behaviours. Even the traits that scored lower, such as Emotional stability in the ‘5 Big Personality’ test, should not be interpreted as not being present. Rather, these traits are not as present as main traits that scored higher, and the results serve as an indication that the lesser scoring traits need to be accounted for more consciously. The results of the study type test also suggest that by being a pragmatic, I prefer more visual and hands on learning to understand something and would rather attempt trial and error to see if something works. </p>

<h2> Personal Information:  </h2>
<p> Gabriel Duke: My name is Gabriel Duke, my student number at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) is s3785307,<br> I have grown up here in Melbourne, I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Science (Biology). My hobbies include boxing, numismatics, comic books, and collecting Vinyl records.<br>
 My interest in IT is purely to learn practical ways to stay up to date in the 21st century and to make sure I can stay relevant to the ever-growing technology industry.<br>
 I have zero experience in IT, so I am extremely excited to be working with our team Genesis I.T.</p>

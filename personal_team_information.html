<h2> Personal Information:  </h2>
<p><b>Gabriel Duke:</b> My name is Gabriel Duke, my student number at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) is s3785307,<br> I have grown up here in Melbourne, I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Science (Biology). My hobbies include boxing, numismatics, comic books, and collecting Vinyl records.<br>
 My interest in IT is purely to learn practical ways to stay up to date in the 21st century and to make sure I can stay relevant to the ever-growing technology industry.<br>
 I have zero experience in IT, so I am extremely excited to be working with our team Genesis I.T.</p> 
 <br>
  <p><b>Robert Mitrovski:</b> I am an 18-year-old who is doing a Bachelor of Information Technology (1st Year) studying at RMIT.<br> During my spare time my hobbies are to play video games and to read about history. 
 My favourite part about I.T is web development<br> and I’m also interested with keeping up to date with the newest hardware. 
 My experience with I.T is still small so please don’t go too hard on me ha ha <br> but I will try my very best to help the team to the best of my ability. I look forward to working with all you guys this semester!
    <br>
  <p><b>Liam Higginson:</b>  My name is Liam Higginson. I am an 18 year old first year in RMIT.<br> I am currently doing my 3 year Bachelor of IT and my main hobbies include making 
    music and lifting at the gym. I have been introduced to computer hardware when I was young due to my father being involved in the IT field <br>but my knowledge is still very limited. 
    Some of my personal attributed include being very goal-driven in <br>that I will always put my best effort when attempting to achieve something, although this effort may be inconsistent sometimes. 
    I am keen on working with this group to do this assignment. </p>

    <br>One fact about me is that I built and have a $2000 gaming pc that I barely use to play games on. Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, watching and reading anime, going to the gym, and playing video games. Additionally,
    <br>I enjoy meeting new people and making new friends as I intend to experience this through RMIT as I believe I will meet wonderful people there.</p>

    <br>I'm studying at RMIT university to receive a Bachelor in information technology so that I can go on to computer science.

  <p><b>Ashley Hu:</b> My name is Ashley, I am a first year Information Technology (IT) student at RMIT and I graduated high school in 2015.<br> I studied Engineering at Monash University for 2 years afterwards but did not find the course fulfilling and something I wanted to do in the future,<br> so I stopped and went on to work full time for 3 years in hospitality.
   I have always had an interest in IT so in 2021 I decided that I would give myself another chance at university.<br> My background is Chinese but have resided in Melbourne for all my life. In addition to speaking Mandarin and English, <br>I also studied Japanese in high school and thoroughly studying languages so I am also excited to learn the various languages in IT.

  <h2> Personal Information:  </h2>
  <p><b>Gabriel Duke:</b> Being the “Protagonist” a so called ‘natural born leader, <br>full of passion and charisma’ I have a fantastic opportunity to work with others and help them grow and achieve their goals in this team. <br>

Being a ‘kinesthetic learner’ shows that I get most of my education through actions rather than reading or listening to lectures.<br> This can help in the team through my urge to get stuck into the work and get things done to make the most of this assignment. 

<br>Being a ‘transformative leader’ should allow me to share our successes as a team and make sure everyone feels valued for their contributions! </p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Robert Mitrovski:</b> I belong to INTP-T, I like to constantly improve myself and learn new stuff I am under the ’logician’ category I like to think in a more logical way,
    <br>and this is a good trait to have as I believe it will help the group a lot when we are working on our assignment.
    <br>I am however not very good with my creativity a lot however either way I will try my best to be creative as well and not just logical. </p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Liam Higginson:</b> My personality type is INTJ-A. This archetype highlights that I am a perfectionist who is quite introverted. <br>
  Having an “Architect” personality would be very useful in team work as I usually prefer ‘quality’ over ‘quantity’. <br>
  In addition to be more thinking than feeling, that my rational brain holds more power over my emotional brain. <br>
  Although sometimes the “Architect” personality is inconsistent as some days I lack motivation for perfection while others I do. </p>

  <p><b>Hayden Lay:</b> My personality being the Defender (ISFJ-T), this illustrates myself to be introverted – <br>
    shy and not wanting to interact with other people, observant – analyse situations and individuals’ expressions, feeling – <br> 
    more emotionally driven than rationally, judging – I identify whether a risk is worth taking or not, and turbulent<br>
    – always aim to push myself and go above and beyond with my work and tasks. These results gave me a proper overview of myself where<br> 
    I am the reserved type of person who has good analytical abilities, well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. </p>

    <br>
    <p><b>Ashley Hu:</b> The results suggest that I am an open-minded person who is open to new ideas as well as being a more extroverted individual <br>
      as well as someone who prefers a hands-on approach to tasks. This would mean that in a team environment I<br>
      would be someone that prefers to initiate conversation and put ideas forward. <br>
      I would also be someone that would suggest trying something even if I am unsure if it will be guaranteed to work.<br>
      As a result, I could provide good leadership and direction to be a voice for a group.<br>
      However, the downside could be that I may disregard the ideas of others or overlook certain steps that require more thorough thinking. </p>

          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <img src="images/Justin.PNG" width="200px">
          <p>my name is Justin Walton, I am a data engineer at Coles supermarkets, and I have been in the I.T industry for three years now. I started out my career as a software engineer intern as part of the nab intern program in 2019 and that was for a year and then at the start of 2020, I was fortunate enough to secure a full-time position as a Dev Ops engineer at national Australia bank so also did that for a year and this year I have just started at Coles, and I am working as a data engineer. I think my experience is quite mixed so it is really a mix between cloud engineering Dev Ops engineering and of course now data engineering so I would not say I am a data engineer, or a cloud engineer I would say I am a mix of all.</p>
          <h4>What kind of work does Justin do?</h4>
          <p>Justin currently works as a Data Engineer but has had various other positions in the past and has been in a variety of projects and teams. The work that Justin does varies but here are some of the projects that he has worked on or is currently working on which will provide insight on some examples or work that is done as an IT professional.</p>

          <p>Justin is currently working with the Coles enterprise data platform (EDP). This is a cloud native data platform which aims to gather data from multiple and disparate source systems in calls and have them in a unified data platform which will then then have the data readily available for data scientists to do advanced analytics such as feeding into machine learning models. The data is also for business users to do reporting on the health and operations of the business.</p>

          <p>Data engineering it is a multi-step function where you are retrieving data from multiple sources and cleaning the data, preparing it and, in some cases, engineering the data to a state where it is to be ready to be consumed by data scientists or business users.</p>

          <p>Justin also has previous experience working with National Australia Bank (NAB) and the projects done here include similarities with his project at Coles but are also varied. His first project was the NAB cloud guild. This is a team/project which aimed to run training programs for employees within the bank and this was a cloud certification training program, and the main function was to increase cloud literacy and skills within the bank which the bank could then use to go forward with any cloud projects that they wanted to achieve. Justin then moved on to the NAB data hub which is very similar to the project he is currently working on. It is a unified cloud native greenfield project, and it aims to achieve the same goals that EDP does at Coles. It is a unified data platform creating a single repository of data which can then be passed on to either reporting teams or data scientists.</p>

          <p>Companies are generating so much data, but they need somewhere to store it, create a single source of truth and be able to share this data at scale with the rest of the business. Justin states that data and data platforms are very popular now and of cloud technology is in demand and used a lot by many companies. </p>
          <h4>Who does Justin mainly interact with as an IT professional</h4>
          <p>In Justin’s team he works with other data engineers and technical staff and interacts with these types of people daily. He also interacts with engineering managers which are also technical, but they have a managerial role within the team. There are also project managers which he also interacts with but less often compared to team members. Justin describes himself as the guy on the ground doing all the daily technical tasks, so he does not really work with the project manager too much but on occasion he does. He also notes that the roles he has been in are not customer facing and are all office type jobs. As such, He does not interact with customers at all.</p>

          <p>the platform Justin working on provides inputs to advanced analytics teams consisting of data scientists and reporting teams. From time to time, he may be in contact with them regarding any requirements they have or feedback, but these communications are not as frequent as with other data engineers. Every single day his team does something called a stand-up where everyone gives an update on what they did yesterday, what they are going to work on today and if they are facing any blockers with the tasks.  External colleagues such as the data scientists would be communicated with much less frequently and spoken with only once a month on average.</p>
          <h4>What Justin does usually as an IT professional</h4>
          <p>The work that an IT professional does changes every day but a general idea of what might happen in the day of Justin is as follows. Starting in the morning there is a something called a stand-up, so the team all gets together discusses what they worked on yesterday and what they are going to work on today and any blockers or challenges that they are facing with their tasks that have been assigned to them. After that it is usually free reign, and everyone works on their assigned tasks. some other tasks or activities he might partake in would be code review with fellow data engineers for example, developer A will write up some code and he wants to merge it into the existing code base and for part of that process there would be a code review where people close to this code would review developer A's code. If they have any feedback, they will raise it with developer A, if not, developer B, C, D etc would approve and merge the code into the existing code base so that is something that happens from time to time and it is very important because everyone owns the code, so it is very important that any code changes are inspected carefully. Another thing is also writing documentation technical documentation. Working in the IT industry is not all just coding as you do have to write up some reports and documentation as well. For example, if there is a program that you have written, putting that into a source control manager or just uploading the code simply will not be enough. It is important that you explain this code and what it does, how it works and any other important information that needs to be included.</p>
          <h4>What Justin did not expect to do as an IT professional</h4>
          <p>When Justin first joined the IT industry, He thought it would just be writing code all day, but it is more than that. To pick one example the writing of documentation is a bigger task than he expected. He explains that it is very important that this is done for big software projects and for every hour that you spend writing code you would probably spend the equal amount of time writing the associated documentation. Justin agrees that this is also very important for university students to understand and get used to and also says, if you have your own GitHub project or something like that getting into the habit of just writing a bit of documentation for the end user would be very useful and it is a skill that you will develop and be ready for when you join the Industry.</p>
          <h4>Challenges working in the IT industry</h4>
          <p>As IT people in the IT industry, it is very easy to get caught up in all the technical jargon. When talking about very technical concepts when you are in the industry, you may find that you need to explain these concepts to business users and these business users may not understand what you are talking about. It is something that Justin found challenging at the start of his career and needed to learn to make sure that he explains things a way which is easy for everyone to understand and believes there is an art to making technical concepts understandable by everyone.</p>

          <p>Something else that he found challenging being in the industry is that the IT field is always changing and evolving so you cannot just learn a technology once and then be set forever. You always need to pick up new tools and technologies, so I think that is a challenge that some people face; Making sure you are up to date with the latest tools. it is also very rewarding because you feel like you are always continually developing, and you are never stuck doing the same thing all the time. The skills required in IT are not just learned once and then set forever. You need to keep picking up new tools and while some people have decades of experience in the industry, it is almost as if some of their experiences are not relevant anymore. While you do learn engineering principles and design through experience, in terms of the most up to date technologies that companies are using it is not the best when senior engineers don’t have the skills to use them.</p>
          <h4>Would you consider changing to a different field in the I.T industry one day and if you did what would it be? </h4>
          <p>Justin says, I think the beauty of IT is that it is quite interconnected so moving within the field is always an option if you get bored of what you are currently doing so if I had to pick a field, I will probably look at cyber security. I just think that the work is very interesting, and the field is growing now. There is a lot of demand for cyber security experts and of course with high demand is a high pay which is always nice but getting into networks and security, it is always something that has fascinated me so if I had to change my profession within this field I would go for cyber security.</p>

          <h3>Smart drop box link:</h3>
          <p>https://www.amazon.com/Key-by-Amazon-In-Garage-Delivery/b?ie=UTF8&node=21222091011</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Our project idea is a stationary drop-box which postmen have access to drop off specific packages to customers. Postmen will utilize an NFC card and/or phone application which allows them to have specific access inside the drop box for them to deposit the customers ordered goods, adhering to Covid-19 contactless delivery while keeping packages safe from theft and weather damage.  And by having a box that only licensed delivery drivers can access, it also stops annoying junk mail that litters our mailboxes.</p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>The team’s motivation for this project is to ensure safety of their delivered packages from theft and for the peace of mind with your package being safe while not at home. The use of these smart drop-boxes also negates the possibility of a package being delivered to the wrong address. And with blocking out the way of unregistered junk mail, consumers can know safely what is going in their mailbox at what time and by who, to allow complete safety of the products being delivered, and accountability to the delivery drivers who may damage the products.</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>

          <p>This design is rather simple, a keycard using Near-Field communication (NFC), or a QR Code scanning app will allow access to postboxes by registered delivery services. The box can be made of multiple materials (wood, metal, etc.) in order to protect the items from a rise in porch theft, and also protect the delivered items from the weather (Rain) that may soil letters and packages. The box will contain a working lock system that will allow for safe and secure holding of letters similar to P.O. boxes, but the electronic aspect will include tracking of the access made to it. Such as the time of delivery, and which company has delivered these items (Aus post, Startrack, UPS, Amazon, etc.) to ensure complete accountability to delivery promises made by companies. The unique locking system to each household will also help to prevent false deliveries to the wrong addresses of your neighbors, ensuring that what gets put in your postbox is yours. And if for some reason the wrong package is placed in your mailbox, then the data provided to the system will allow the user to contact the company and have them pick up the wrongly delivered package.</p>

          <p>A weighted system within the box can also detect the size of packages and allow the user to track if they have left something in their mailbox accidentally, or if something has gone missing.</p>

          <p>There could be two wire designs available, wireless (with a batter) or wired to an electricity port connected to the house. Aside from those, the product will mostly be wireless as NFC’s use radio-frequency identification to operate, meaning no useless wires crowding up the area and adding.</p>

          <p>In addition to this, the box will also feature four metal protrusions with holes on the bottom of the box fixing to each corner, this is so the customer utilizing the smart drop box can bolt down the box so thieves are not able to move the entire box or knock it over. The aesthetic design of this box will be a horizontal rectangle prism with a slope at the top where the hatch will be, this hatch will be openable and closable with the NFC key card or the QR code given to the delivery service. Packages can then be dropped into the box. Inside of the box would be cushions so packages do not get damaged when dropped into the box. The hatch at the top will have rubber seals along the edges so water cannot seep through its edges when it is raining. If the smart-box malfunctions and a customer cannot open the box to retrieve their package, they can send an issue ticket to the website which will then send a request for an employee to go and open the box with a specially designated Master Tag, which can open every smart box. Each Master Tag will have its own referral ID so if one gets lost, an employee can report their tag ID and get the tag terminated so it cannot open other smart boxes until retrieved or a new tag is assigned.</p>

          <h3>Skills required</h3>
          <p>In order to get this project up and running, the skills needed include fluency in the programs that can program NFCs (Near Field Communication) like NFC Task Launcher, or NFC Writer, and NFC Tag Writer. Being able to code these tags into working with simple lock and key methods should allow us to get the project started. Next if we wished to use an app for it instead of a tag, we would need the skills to program an app that can use NFC’s off of phones (as most phones have them nowadays). Next, we would need the skills to build up a database that can store data from multiple entries, each person who gets the drop box would have an account, and data from each person accessing the box would be stored (the workers company, and the employee number). This data would be stored on a server and should be accessible to consumers so that they can see their own access data.</p>

          <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
          <p>We would need access to lots of supply of NFC tags, and to supply delivery companies with a scanner or an app that would be able to accurately scan individual tags. We would also need to put together a secure box system that would be able to be locked into place, weather proof through rubber materials and also have a pressure-plate/scale to detect the weight that is being put into the box. This box could be metal, wood, or another durable material dependent on each houses look. The box could come in multiple sizes depending on if the consumer is living in a house or belongs to a business that ships some of the more heavy-duty equipment around. Although, if the boxes are metal they would likely be made with Corten Steel or otherwise known as Weathering Steel, this is because if the box is made out of steel or iron, the rust would eventually break corrode away the electronic hatch at the top, also further corroding could even potentially make holes in box or make the metal very brittle and easy to break. Corten Steel on the other hand, contains up to 21% of alloying elements which drastically reduces the corrosion rate of rust and this material is also cheaper than stainless steel. In addition, if the box is uses wood, the wood would be very dense and strong enough to the point where it rivals that of metal, also inside the wooden outer layer would feature a metal reinforcement on the inside of the box as if regular wood is used, thieves could easily smash or burn the wood to retrieve the customers contents.</p>

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>The overall outcome and benefits of a system like this would lead to safer, more efficient, and a more accountable post delivery system. Ensuring that thieves cannot simply steal a package off a porch or mailbox, it should also remove the need that some delivery companies have of having someone present at home to receive the package, otherwise it goes back to the post office. This system should simplify and cut out all the unnecessary drama of, waiting for a package, worrying about its safety upon arrival, condition due to weather conditions, and hassle of certain delivery companies not keeping their promises to deliver on time (as you know when the items are delivered).</p>

          <p>The use of unique NFC’s should also allow a tracking system that in the event of theft (Thieves using NFC’s to unlock the boxes) information about it will be logged on the system so that it can be passed onto the relevant authorities.</p>

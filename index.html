          <h2>Genisis I.T members introduction</h2>
          <h4>Robert Mitrovski</h4>
          <p>I am an 18-year-old who is doing a Bachelor of Information Technology (1st Year) studying at RMIT. During my spare time my hobbies are to play video games and to read about history. My favourite part about I.T is web development and I’m also interested with keeping up to date with the newest hardware. My experience with I.T is still small so please don’t go too hard on me ha ha but I will try my very best to help the team to the best of my ability. I look forward to working with all you guys this semester!</p>
          <h4>Hayden Lay</h4>
          <p>My name is Hayden Lay and I am studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT, and my student number is s3897249. I was born in Australia, Darwin, however, my background and culture is Timorese where I usually speak Chinese Hakka at home. One fact about me is that I built and have a $2000 gaming pc that I barely use to play games on. Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, watching and reading anime, going to the gym, and playing video games. Additionally, I enjoy meeting new people and making new friends as I intend to experience this through RMIT as I believe I will meet wonderful people there.</p>
          <h4>Gabriel Duke</h4>
          <p>My name is Gabriel Duke, my student number at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) is s3785307, I have grown up here in Melbourne, I am currently undertaking a Bachelor of Science (Biology). My hobbies include boxing, numismatics, comic books, and collecting Vinyl records. My interest in IT is purely to learn practical ways to stay up to date in the 21st century and to make sure I can stay relevant to the ever-growing technology industry. I have zero experience in IT, so I am extremely excited to be working with our team Genesis I.T.</p>
          <h4>Ashley Hu</h4>
          <p>My name is Ashley, I am a first year Information Technology (IT) student at RMIT and I graduated high school in 2015. I studied Engineering at Monash University for 2 years afterwards but did not find the course fulfilling and something I wanted to do in the future, so I stopped and went on to work full time for 3 years in hospitality. I have always had an interest in IT so in 2021 I decided that I would give myself another chance at university. My background is Chinese but have resided in Melbourne for all my life. In addition to speaking Mandarin and English, I also studied Japanese in high school and thoroughly studying languages so I am also excited to learn the various languages in IT.</p>
          <h4>Liam Higginson</h4>
          <p>My name is Liam Higginson. I am an 18 year old first year in RMIT. I am currently doing my 3 year Bachelor of IT and my main hobbies include making music and lifting at the gym. I have been introduced to computer hardware when I was young due to my father being involved in the IT field but my knowledge is still very limited. Some of my personal attributed include being very goal-driven in that I will always put my best effort when attempting to achieve something, although this effort may be inconsistent sometimes. I am keen on working with this group to do this assignment.</p>
          <h4>Issac Miles</h4>
          <p>My name is Isaac Miles I'm 21 years old and was born in England but moved to Australia in 2006, I'm studying at RMIT university to receive a Bachelor in information technology so that I can go on to computer science. Ive been around computers my entire life so I can say what got me interested in them but my interest in them now revolves around cyber security and game development. hobby wise I play pc games, read or make art not much else. An interesting thing about me is I'm a Non identical twin.</p>

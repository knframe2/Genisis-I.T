          <h4>Roles</h4>
          <p>Robert – Figma designer: I did Figma because I have experience with it and I know how to use the website very well, so I did that role and was able to complete the artefact.</p>
          
          <p>Isaac - Lead designer / technical designer: I defined myself as a lead and technical designer because I presented the original idea, created the renders and wrote out the functionality. This would be the things a designer would do.</p>
          
          <p>Gabriel – I defined myself as a writer and consultant to the team, writing out specifics for how the product would work, its justification for the market, and how certain elements needed to be justified before we put them into the final product and how they were weighed up for the risk management. I fit this role as I love to write, and think critically about how mechanisms/projects work, and love to play advocate for the ‘why’ motive.</p>
          
          <p>Liam - Writer I defined myself as the main writer as I had lots of knowledge on the product we were making since I did a good amount of the Project Idea section in our groups last assignment.</p>
          
          <p>Hayden – Writer #2/ Figma designer #2: I assigned to take both the writer and Figma designer role within my group. I took the writer role as I feel confident in answering questions as well as, presenting useful information that are appropriate to our project. I also took the role of a Figma designer because due to having experience using FIGMA from my UCD class, I have the knowledge and skills needed into help completing the app design of our project.</p>
          
          <p>Ashley –</p>
          
          <h4>Scopes and limits</h4>
          <p>Scope: By the submission date of this assignment, our group should have time to produce a digital prototype which would present our smart lockbox, with working hinges on the inside, and an NFC attachment which should show consumers a rough draft of what the box would look like, and how it would work. Along with this we should produce a draft app which would highlight an interface for what it would look like for consumers, and for delivery workers who use the box.  

          Limits: producing an actual box within the time frame of this assignment seems unlikely, so unfortunately, we have opted for an online alternative, along with this, the app design will not be front end polished, nor fully functioning with the NFC device, while it would be ideal to have them working and examples, the time limit on this assignment realistically only leaves time for concept work (especially with delivery times on online orders for us to put this together)</p>
          
          <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
          <li>We use Microsoft Teams for our meetings with the group so we can talk about what we have been doing for our project and when we want to assign the group roles to do for the project.</li>
          <li>We use GitHub so that we can all combine the work that we have put into a website and then host it using GitHub.io.</li>
          <li>We will use Figma so we can design the app prototype</li>
          <li>We will use Discord if there are any important announcements to make that is urgent and to contact specific members about stuff.</li>
          
          <h4>Testing</h4>
          <p>Before we start testing this project, our group must create a test plan. This test plan includes various outcomes and addition information of the test. 

          The product which we will be testing is the app which comes with the product. The goal of this test is observing how users navigate through our app. This can be used to judge how those of our potential users think when using applications foreign to them. Some equipment required could be eye tracking software and recording the sessions with cameras. In these test users must be able to look for the smart box location, which was assigned to them, as they must deliver their product to the right box in the correct location. The type of testing which would be used would be a formal usability lab.</p>
          
          <h4>Formal usability lab</h4>
          <p>Our testing will involve a formal usability lab. This is a facility which is designed in a way that is:</p>
            <li>Low-traffic low noise area</li>
            <li>Good lighting</li>
            <li>Electrical ventilation and ceiling requirements</li>
            <li>One-way mirror</li>
            <li>Digital audio/video screen capture</li>
            <li>Event logging</li>
            <li>Editing system</li>
          <p>A plan of tasks will be given to each of the testers. This is in the form of a scenario.</p>
          <p>Metrics taken into observation will be:</p>
          <li>Time taken to complete tasks, starting state, finished state, extra information required and possible deviations.</li>
          
          <h4>Risks</h4>
          <p>There are many risks that are posed to this project idea, both business wise and functionality wise, that would affect the functionality of this project and its success in practice.</p>
          <li>Business wise</li>
          <p>There may not be a need for this product to be used, post companies and consumers, may in general, be fine with the way things are, and aren’t particularly worried about mail or parcel safety as they live in an area that is less likely to be affected by extreme weather, or thieves. So, it would be an opt in for consumers to make that choice, which could end up meaning not a lot of people want to try it or find it too much of a hassle. The other end of that is postage-delivery businesses may decide its easier and would take less time for them if they did not deliver to people with these secure lockboxes. If we do not make the project simple and effective, and provide them with good enough reasons as to why they might need it, they may end up not being used at all, and people would rather have their normal mailbox.</p>
          <h4>Group and processes</h4>
          <li>Functionality wise</li>
          <p>There are a few functions from the beginning that may pose a risk to the project's success. The design of the box may be the primary objection that users would have to opting into this product. Along with its size and having it placed somewhere on their property to be locked down may not be something that renters would be allowed to install, along with people not wanting to change the way their property might look, even if it’s a small change. The box must be completely weather proofed, it needs to be tight enough to avoid rain damage, and solid enough to avoid heat damage and prevent forced entry, and so if these measures aren’t put into place from the beginning, it would be hard for consumers to see a solid reason as to why they would want the product. The use of NFC’s also poses a risk, first if the NFC stops working, people will not be able to easily get their packages, so a backup option must be implemented. But the possibility of thieves hacking the box in some way by using their own rigged NFCs could also deter users from bothering to get the box in the first place, as thieves may look for houses with these boxes and seek them out, painting a target on the house essentially.</p>
          
          <h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
          <p>For meetings and discussions, we use Microsoft Teams to come up with ideas, to clarify roles and members workloads, and distribute work evenly to each member, as well as form discussions and keep up with each group members progress. While Microsoft Teams is predominantly our main source of discussions and catch ups, we also use Discord to schedule meetings and post important notes and remainders for members to see as everyone predominantly use Discord as their main source of communication.
          
          We try to schedule meetings twice a week using a technology called Microsoft Teams to catch up with everyone and check up on their progress of their tasks in the assignment. We usually plan these meetings at the end of our last meetings, so everyone knows, but we also post reminders on Discord like 2 or 3 days before our schedule meeting on Microsoft Teams to ensure every member arrive on team.  
          
          A case where a group member does not respond to our regular updates and news on Discord, we will try to inform them about any updates that they have missed out on the next meetings when they attend. However, if the member regularly and consistently does not attend to our meetings on Microsoft Teams or doesn’t respond to any messages and updates on Discord, we will have to inform this poor commitment and lack of communication to our lecture teacher to help resolve this issue.</p>
